Connecting through bluetooth
//Connect PS5 Controller to Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth:
	•	Turn on your PS5 controller and put it in pairing mode (hold the PS + Share button until the light blinks).
	•	On your Raspberry Pi, run:

bluetoothctl

//Inside bluetoothctl:

power on
agent on
default-agent
scan on

// Wait until you see your controller’s MAC address and pair with it:

pair <controller_mac_address>
trust <controller_mac_address>

connect <controller_mac_address>

Finally, exit bluetoothctl by typing exit.


screen streaming
// start the vnc : 

vncserver :1

1. Find the VNC server address: The VNC server address will be displayed in the terminal output. It will look something like :1 (the number might be different).
2. Install a VNC client on your Mac: There are several VNC clients available for Mac, such as RealVNC, Screen Sharing, or others.
3. Connect to the Raspberry Pi's VNC server: Open the VNC client on your Mac and enter the VNC server address, including the display number (e.g., raspberrypi.local:1 or 192.168.1.100:1).
